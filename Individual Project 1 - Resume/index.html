              <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a scripting or programming language
              that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
              time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
              information for you to look at — displaying timely content
              updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling
              video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably
              involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
              technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much
              more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

              <strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most
              basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
              structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are
              generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation
              (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). "Hypertext" refers
              to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a
              single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect
              of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
              pages created by other people, you become an active participant in
              the World Wide Web.

              <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a stylesheet
              language used to describe the presentation of a document written
              in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
              XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen,
              on paper, in speech, or on other media. CSS is among the core
              languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers
              according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of
              various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which
              allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might
              have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a
              CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version
              number.

              <strong>Python</strong> is a high level general-purpose
              programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning
              it supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional
              programming constructs. It was created by Guido van Rossum as a
              successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990,
              and is currently used on a large array of domains like web
              development, desktop applications, data science, DevOps, and
              automation/productivity.

              All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS),
              a tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a
              project without the danger of them overwriting each other's work,
              and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem
              is discovered later on. The most popular VCS (at least among web
              developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that provides
              hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with
              them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about
              both of them.

                  After years of eperience in the construction industry, I have
                  decided to spread my horizon. I have been a tech savy person
                  since I was in grade school. I love building my own computer
                  and fiddle around its software. I learned about refocus
                  through their adds and decided to give it a try. Programming
                  has been like a missing piece of my life. I can comfortable
                  say they programming fits me like a glove. I'm looking forward
                  in expanding my tech arsenal as I move forward in this new
                  career.

                  Studying architecture has real helped me appreciate understand
                  and feel the importance of design and design flow. The
                  complexity of every design and how it coincide with each
                  others create a simple and perfect effect that would last
                  milleniums. The flow of spaces is as important as it guides
                  every person who walks through our buildings. The combination
                  of colors that can affect out moods as it also affects the
                  auro around us. All this I have learned.

                  Civil Engineering has taught me how detailed calculation is

                  we desire. A strong foundation is the most importance part of
