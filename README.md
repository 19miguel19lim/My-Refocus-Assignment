# My-Refocus-Assignment

Hello, My name is Jose Miguel M Lim, Im currently a student of Refocus studying web development and programming. 

This is my first repository, in here you will find all my assignments which have been approved by my mentors. I hope someday, 
I can look back in this repo and be reminded of how far I have come. May this repo inspire other people as well, the first step 
will always be the hardest but once you get that ball rolling, theres nothing stoping you.

My hobbies: 
- I like to workout
- I learned recently that studying is also a good hobby. It relaxes me and gives me tools which I can use.
- I like to read. For the past few months, I've read multiple docs about frameworks and more. 
- I like to cook
- Im a keyboard enthusiast
- Im a gamer (currently playing overwatch 2)
- I like building PC

Goal for 2023
- hope I can land a job as a software engineer.
- learn more frameworks and other languages

Reasons why I want to be a web developer
- The space opened my eyes to countless possibilities. The fact that I can build anything gets me excited.
- The challenges are taugh, but reading through docs and reading how people do it really excites me. The best part of it all is when
I run my code, it gives me a sensation thats hard to explain. 
- I want a better opportunity for my family. I'll work hard for them.
